# Learning how to learn
> web_project_1

"Learning how to learn" (web_project_1) is my first project at Practicum by Yandex. I've done it during the "Advanced HTML and CSS" course.
In this course, I discovered how much HTML and CSS have to offer by working through topics such as flexbox, animations, forms, positioning elements, and embedding media content. I also learned how to organize my code and structure my projects using the BEM methodology, as well as how to manage my project with Git.

## Technologies and Techniques

While developing web_project_1 I used the folowing technologies and techniques:
* HTML5, CSS3, markdown
* BEM — Block Element Modifier is a methodology that helps you to create reusable components and code sharing in front-end development
* Visual Studio Code, Git
* Responsive web design, Semantic markup
